                        "In the 1960s there was a shortage of workers in the UK, so I left my home in Africa to work in a shipyard in Liverpool. When I arrived, I changed my family name to 'Baker' so it would be easier for English people to pronounce. I became a British citizen because I was born in a Commonwealth country and my mother was British."

                <p><strong>A citizen</strong> is someone who has the legal right to live in a particular country. Philippe became a UK citizen through a process called <strong>naturalisation</strong>.</p>
