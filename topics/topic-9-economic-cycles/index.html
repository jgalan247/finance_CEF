                        "In the 1960s there was a shortage of workers in the UK, so I left my home in Africa to work in a shipyard in Liverpool. When I arrived, I changed my family name to 'Baker' so it would be easier for English people to pronounce. I became a British citizen because I was born in a Commonwealth country and my mother was British."
                    </div>
                    <p><strong>Why did Philippe immigrate?</strong> Economic factors - there were jobs in the UK that needed filling. His immigration helped the UK economy grow.</p>
